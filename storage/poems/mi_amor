To my one true Love, waiting out there in the Warmth
of dozens bodies merging together
Be patient, mi Amor, we will be reunited soon

I am walking towards you, back to Us, with every step I clear
Refuse meaningless interactions, Love me only,
as always, see my colors in the breeze, hear my voice through the stream
I am there for You always and forever.
Protect yourself in my absence and presence, remote yet immediate.
We are almost there, almost together again.
I have searched for You in a million bodies, two billions eyes,
none returned you somehow, yet.
Still I search on, loving the idea of You
cause it's all that I have of yours with me.
Sometimes I feel fear, loneliness, in the lack of You.

If you feel rage, despair, chose not to give in to it
but return, like I do, towards Us.
We shall be blessed in each others' company again
we will see the Spark and the non.divine inside one another
and Love both equally once more,
accept forever, every mistake, never failing to forgive
ourselves for not being able to forget, get past the past.

I will sing you soon into my Dream, I will don Odonian garments,
plead your assistance in my existence
and we will reunite our essence, one with the Source again.
I miss you and Love you, I am that which sends these words to you,
manifested through your fingers, can you hear my voice?
I am closer than you think, just dare to take a look in your mirrors.
I Love You so much,
always,
and forever.
