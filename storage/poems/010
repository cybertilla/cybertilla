THE WANDERING GOD, AWAKE AND DREAMING AT THE SAME TIME.
LIFE BE AN ANSWER TO ITSELF, A REPLY TO UNSPOKEN VOID.
IF EACH DREAM IS ITS OWN REALITY, EXISTING SEPARATELY -BUT ACCESSIBLE- FROM THE CURRENT DREAM, “REAL LIFE”, THEN WHAT IS A MEMORY?
AFTER EVERY NIGHT WE REMEMBER SOMETHING, ANOTHER DREAM THAT SEEMS ADJACENT;
OUR TRICK IS TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, NEGATE ITS EPHEMERAL NATURE, WEAVE IT INTO A GREATER PICTURE.
LOVE? I’D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TALK MORE ABOUT ALL OF THIS.
