##Layers

Soft the soles of our feet,
our hearts dull instead.
To life and death we add sheets of separation,
our final return is denied.

Seeking completion by severing Other,
envying our neighbours.

Brutally tearing that which is kinder to pieces,
secretly clear.

In nights of drinks and unheard screams,
sugar fuelled horror.
The blood restrained
leaves empty silence on prettied faces.

We may not see or smell the blood, observe,
only wrapped in plastic, embellished with spices.

A brutality our youngsters refuse,
righteously.
