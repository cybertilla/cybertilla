Sounds wake me up again. I have to move.
Away. Away from the memories in this town.
They seep up at Night, filling the space inside me.
Crawling the walls, finding all ways to stalk
the sleeping creature. When they get close and I’m asleep
they sneak into my head. Bending my dreams, so peaceful on the whole,
to nightmare.
I am ready to leave.
Coffee’s on the stove.
