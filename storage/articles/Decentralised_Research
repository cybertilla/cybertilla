###Abstract
The Freelabs of sci-fi novels are coming, and they are vital to disrupt cognitive bias embed in normative scientific research environments.   Introduction, the faults in normative research  Present day, private and public research have undeniable weak spots: privately supported research is easily manipulated and directed by funders, whereas academic research is reserved to scholars who desire to maintain prestige and conformity. In both cases, scientists are required to publish as often as possible so to maintain fundings and grants, which forces them to see meaning even in most inconsistent data out of need for status survival.[1] Moreover, the access to raw data and experimental method context is greatly limited by institutional regulations, which lowers the ability of the public to revision discoveries and append their insights. Is there another way to scientific research that can diversify standpoints and correct established yet misleading assumptions? The best option is comparing data from various sources originated in radically different settings and allow as many individuals as possible -of those with a pertinent interest- to check and interpret such information. The author´s proposed solution to described issues is the implementation of decentralized independent research alongside established institutions.   What is decentralized research?  Imagine a network of independent research labs sharing results, methods and data with an absolute approach. The only effective way to embrace human curiosity and intellect is sharing data from individuals committed to invest time and energy exploring a subject that ignites their passion, such individuals are therefore unbiased by academic preconceptions[2] or economical conditioning. A prestigious-free, less-biased approach to scientific research promoting collective development.  In pragmatic terms, such model implies an association without a single main benefactor nor beneficiary enabled to share open source data on the internet; in other words, a space where individuals can experiment without being subject to pressure generated by organizational hierarchies, internal or external (which entails holacracy and diversified funding) nor cultural discriminations (open-mindedness).   The rise of IRL(Independent Research Labs) is not to be seen as a threat to normative research structures, but rather as a useful annex.  Considering a modern worldwide view, the western mindset could provide healthy skepticism towards eastern holistic concepts, while the same eastern approach resolves the separatistic habit flawing western inquiries. The more varied labs purposes and conditions are, the more reliable the analysis derived by comparing multiple dataset results. The multitude and diversification of individuals -with disparate life experience, sensibility and motivations- reveals meaning in data which is obscure to fewer selected scientists. [3] Otherwise, our upper class physicians will keep diagnosing complex gastro-enteric diseases to patiences who are, simply, hungry. Imagine looking at a cube from only six fixed point of views, the risk is we´d only always see 2D squares -especially if squares are what we expect to see and what we are subconsciously looking for [4]; many more perspectives are required to gather an accurate idea of the solid in front of us. Now, looking at a hypercube from many different angles mostly returns squares, therefore it is vital to connect many more point of views than we may believe we ought to  connect. The more obscure the subject, the more we can make use of everybody´s brightness.  The Open Source Movement thus acts on scientific research as a noise cancelation mechanism against otherwise invisible, cultural-dependent cognitive biases. It embraces cultural relativism instead of denying it and uses the POV of each human as a precious research tool.   Who is a researcher?  Anybody who observes phenomena and tests hypothesis in order to comprehend reality is a researcher.   The basic requirements for research are: curiosity, or the desire for deeper understanding through critical thinking,  the capability for observation and data recording, practiced under time with senses/sensors a platform to share and compare data, hypothesis, methodology and insights  Any research subject is valid. Remembering we do not understand everything is key to scientific method, therefore, denying the validity of a specific research area is pointless and potentially stagnates progress [5].   Parenthesis on personal development  Personal development is applying scientific research to your life journey.  Each and every one of us is unique. Even with the best intentions, human societies are still unable to provide adequate -much less equal- treatments nor unbiased directives, regardless of which area of Earth we inspection it.  “Kindly let me help you or you will drown” said the monkey placing the fish safely back on the branch.   The healthcare system is equally limited. Each body is unique; each psyche is unique. No one can possibly know our body and mind better that ourselves. Submitting to generalized treatments is useless at best, risky otherwise. The only meaningful lesson on our body and mind are those we prove ourselves. With a research oriented mindset, the individual can design experiments aimed to identify areas -of body and mind- that need to be improved, so to ultimately become who they want to be and not approximate themselves to who other people think they should be. Encouraging individuals to take responsibilities upon their lives, bodies and choices nullifies the feeling of disempowerment that turns societies into alienated groups of robota poisoning themselves in victimization; the antidote to a stagnant society is dynamic, conscious researchers.  More and more spaces designed for independent, decentralized activities are popping up all over the world; for humans are inherently curious.   When is decentralized research?  The process has started already. In our life we have gathered a great amount of data in diverse fields. Responsibility calls us forward to share our knowledge, passion shows us in which field we should focus from now on.   Where is decentralized research?  Independent researchers all over Earth are encouraged to share their knowledge through open source platforms a reach out to IRL, which can be recognized by the fact that they do not affiliate to Universities nor are they solely sponsored by one private or public company. If you wonder where to start from, search for FabLabs, Hubs & Maker spaces in your area, you are sure to find a community of geeks with obsessive-like interests spanning from electronics to soap making. If you find none, consider establishing one yourself.s      How is research decentralized?  	In 2010 Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper and the world got to hear about a new 	technology: blockchain. Blockchain has since been developed into much more than virtual 	currency (one may argue that fiat currencies are also virtual, but that is a topi for another 	dissertation). Distributed ledger technology offers great improvements in security against data 	manipulation, guarantees privacy and integrity. In the past years, many objections have been 	raised against blockchain solutions, mainly because of its difficulty with “scaling”. I propose that 	non-scalability is to be listed among the pro freatures of any system. Tech entrepreneurs 	concerned with profit might not be able to see it, but a net of local blockchain systems is one 	possible, utopian architecture for a near future. Businesses that act locally are automatically more 	sustainable and conscious in their choices, and consistently so. Communications among different 	blockchains might be possible with recent developments[add info].    Conclusion: Why is decentralized research?  Science, which ought to be the most flexible and humble human mindset, has been institutionalized, trapped in a golden cage in exchange for redundant prestige; while curiosity and critical thought are nearly ridiculed. Questioning such establishment is a difficult yet important step to take in the process of re-distributing power. Being responsible as a capable human also means to stop blindly believing in Science or society, but rather see both as one more wondrous tool for the interpretation of existence. When we do not seek meaning for ourselves, we end up living in somebody else's interpretation. Many are the questions to be answered, many more those which need rephrasing. Humbly question your understanding of how the world works, allow space for doubt concerning the most immutable paradigms.     Notes and References *for those who do not trust my uncertified words only:  [1] “How Nonsense Became Excellence” Mathias Binswanger  [2] academic preconceptions= intention has been shown to be greatly influential on experiment results; to summarize “Smarty plants”podcast aired on the 14 Feb 2018 by Radiolab  https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/smarty-plants , a scientist committed to confute a specific hypothesis is not only more likely to ignore proves of that same hypothesis being correct, but might even set up experiments apt to confute the former -more or less consciously-. Therefore, after years of repeating former scholastic knowledge (let alone the years of parrot reward, being gratified for accurate repetition of given knowledge) an academic scientist might result blind to certain facts and tend not to correct previous data nor discover new concepts but rather continue elaborating on the same established model.  [3] Some forms of decentralization in research are already happening; NASA shares some data with volunteers, an un-organized multitude of individuals which demonstrated to be incredibly effective in spotting minute differences: an exemplar use of human-specific abilities in pattern recognition. “Because Planet Hunter volunteers look at every light curve by eye, serendipitous discoveries are inevitable, especially in rich data sets such as that which Keplerhas provided. As such, a key aspect of the Planet Hunters project is the ‘Talk’ interface. ‘Talk’ is a community discussion board/site where volunteers can discuss light curves and present further analysis on objects viewed in the main ‘Classify’ interface.” extract from (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03622.pdf )   [4] example of cognitive biasses https://medium.com/@Angy_Stallone/the-most-common-cognitive-biases-9499bbbf97c7 [5] See an example of scientific blindness https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWU_DnC9t4I
