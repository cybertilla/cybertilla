When you learned to speak you didn't know
but one day those words would have tricked you
caged you
angered you

Many people say there's no such thing as magic these days...
many still don't think it ever existed.
Debilitating myopia
Sinking

Let's gaze into the light
suffused

Speak
in sounds of pearls you lose the sense of rhythm
feel the rhythm of sense
deep
fruitful

Instants pass in words produced
and magically the vibrant thought is born
ancestral
narrated by Us, by You, by All
