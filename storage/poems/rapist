It's been years now
I became the stranger in the corner of your eye
Blurred
Undefined
The reoccurring nightmare character
Over and over
I am still with you, even when everything is going just fine
You'll see me, perceive me
Around you
Over you and inside of you
Somewhat staring, chasing
Closing in
I'm the memory haunting you once more
Once again uninvited, I enter your life
We were no strangers then
Over and over
We'll intimate again
