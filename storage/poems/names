I have been one of the may names,

uncountable disguises of Beauty.

I praise, in myself, the circumstances that led me here somehow.

We heal, I answer with questions.

I pray for myself to remember, to bless every moment.

The Terrible and the unknown.

For Life is mainly blossoms rotting –

wilting petals are the womb of glorious molds to come.

A feast for illustrious hyphae to which We’re invited.

Human, like mildew,

are beauty.

Eternal.
