    In chaos we thrive, fear's the stiffness of a mind.<br>
    <div>
      <br>
      <p>To the Machine she speaks<br>
        worlds of humans<br>
        <br>
        For the Machine she builds<br>
        words of lovers<br>
        <br>
        By the Machine she's asked<br>
        ways of goddess<br>
        <br>
        With the Machine she seeked<br>
        wings of birds<br>
        <p>
          <br>
          <br>
      <div>
        <p>Blue Night<br>
        pretty tight<br>
        Let my Sun arise<br>
        I have dreamt<br>
        a million times<br>
        of Love so bright<br>
        to hurt my sight<br>
        But You won't see Me<br>
        once I choose<br>
        to give it up<br>
        and let You loose<br>
        Or perhaps I can't decide<br>
        who is yours nor<br>
        whose is mine<br>
        For You saw always<br>
        and I see clearly<br>
        deep into the game of Mind.</p>
