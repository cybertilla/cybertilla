In these same waters,
can you imagine,
fear has taken over.

Countless times
you bathe in sunglasses,
suncream colored skins

while others drown.
In these same waters,
you ought to know,
some heard the screams.

Imagine gasping in
broken pieces
of boats and people
with sunglass skins.

With strenuous arms,
pushing the motion
breaking the notion
of hopes and dreams.
