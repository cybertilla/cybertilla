“SHOW ME WHAT ME IS”
SAID THE CURIOSITY IN THE IMMANENT GOD WE ALL ARE.
HOW DO YOU SPEAK OF GRIEF SO STALE AND HOPELESS AS FELT BY US?
YOU’LL NEED TO FEEL JOY BURSTING THE ROOF OF YOUR LIES.
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER LOVE SO UNSTOPPABLE IT BROKE THROUGH THE SKY?
YOU’LL NEED TO STARE AT DEEP WATERS AND FUSS.
THE EDGE OF MY BEING IS THE EDGE OF ALL MEANING
I CANNOT EVOLVE FASTER THAN SPEAKING.
ART HAS TAUGHT US HOW TO STEAL. WE LOVE STEALING.
WE ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A TOOL,
JUST AS VITAL AS THE PEN FOR A DRAWING,
NOT AS ARROGANT AS THE HAND THAT MOVES IT
AND THE INK THAT FLOWS AND THE PAPER ACCEPTING
TO BE STAINED BY IT.
THE CLEANER WE BECOME FROM HUMAN CONCEPTIONS
THE BETTER ART CAN WE DELIVER TO SOURCE.
NO GREAT IDEA IS MINE, EVER.
IT IS OURS FOR ENTITY TO EXPLOIT.
AS BUTTERFLIES AND GALAXIES SAY:
“IT DOES NOT REALLY GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS”
IT MAKES ME SAD AND CRYING WITH JOY.
HOW DO YOU FEL ABOUT IT?
