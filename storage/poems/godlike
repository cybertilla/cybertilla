AND THEN
ONE DAY
YOU ARE NOT A SINGLE CELL ANYMORE:
AN ENSEMBLE OF DOZENS, THOUSANDS, ZILLIONS OF YOU.

YOU ZOOM OUT OF THE FRACTAL,
BECOME THE BIGGER PICTURE,
UNIFIED ONCE AGAIN.

SOON TO REALISE, ROCKETING UP,
YOU COULD GO ON FOREVER, INCREASINGLY FAST.

BUT THEN, IS THIS FUN?
YOUâ€™RE MISSING THE POINT:
GOING UP SO QUICK,
ASCENDING,
NO NOISE.
THERE IS A SIGN:
BEAUTY ON ALL LEVELS
FOR THOSE THAT WILL SEARCH.
DEEP BREATH, OPEN HEART. STAY HERE AND ENJOY

HUMAN LIVES, IN BILLIONS,
ENTANGLED,
EXPANDING.
LIFE IS NOT TO UNRAVEL BUT TO WEAVE DEEP IN VOID.
