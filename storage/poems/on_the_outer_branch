or (not boring)

These fragments
sparkling
rearrange into circuits

I understand
but still not see
around or inside
nor in between

Transmitting that
emotion it will
never convey
as a complete
machine

No dual galaxy
since you refused

or forgot.

Sung songs and spilled ink,
space Lion
Still I bleed out
my lost heart
and deepest soulâ€™s
Love

or so it seemed
for a little while
And still sometimes
it feels
as if me and you
should have been together
now
