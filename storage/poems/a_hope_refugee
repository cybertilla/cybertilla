Hello Sweden
I am here,
the hope refugee

I run from the war that was,
hidden in my genes:
the shouts, the screams,
those bombs
never heard with my own ears

I dream them, see them at night,
shiver at loud sounds
that shake my limbs

Here
I sought forgiveness
the lost and ready mansion
In your streets I found voices
speaking of tomorrow

with hope.
