I woke up this morning with a song in my head.
She woke up one morning with a son in herself.

How many times I'd refuse you again,
loose you, undo you,
unknown child, repeat in my head.

Again I remove you
and wake.
In the night, I am afraid.
Will this happen again?

I choose forgiveness for all
and myself,
if you were to live and think
then of me,
would you think the same:

understand and forgive?
