My dearest friend, so many blamed you, yourself most of all.
The panic of unchosen profession, the purest dread of artistic call.
We've been taught to disregard you, with contempt pity you in that stern fashion. Pretend to be unable to see, unwilling to bend.
But what is the crime of dark children's eyes?
Please, show us the wish of a shameless mind.

And we know what happens to Beauty when it's not observed: it fades, whines, leaves us mute in the grey world. Comfortable, inane. Echoing empty.

My dearest friend, we need you now most of all. Never shut your eyes for our world, in such stale shame we've tried to hide. Keep fiercely seeking, reaching, painting.
You know, looking at beauty is never a crime.
