Who's this lady dressed in plastic,
of plastic filled and flavored?
Searching a beauty that can't be constructed
nor faked by silicone smiles. I sigh.

We're similar, lady of plastic,
seeking qualities we were not given.
Hunting the other, the perfect,
the sweeter. In vain. In
vanity.
We pray, let others see through us
avoiding the surface. Too sleek.

A body. Old oil. We both are destined
to rot and crumble. Time's soft lips
whisper
a magical noise, we chose our way out.
