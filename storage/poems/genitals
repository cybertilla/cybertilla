How wonderful would it be to have a penis?
A lovely extension instead of a hole.
The magic wand erupting sweet juice.
A shaft that can give, a handle to life.

How wonderful would it be to have a pussy?
A lovely cave, soft, caring and warm.
A valley that takes, absorbs all forms of joy.
The origin to mammal produce.
