How dare you assume my silence is an invitation.
Do you believe I enjoy hearing you blabbing all the time?
A constant noise that spoils my peace,
the threat of unspoken requests.

I might be panicking while I focus
every effort
not to let myself slip into courtesy
giggles, eyelashes
the silver ropes that kept us enslaved
for centuries.

So see through my silence and your own insecurity.
Maybe I don't yet have an alternative
to pleasing
but as I find my words I will tell you:
shut up for a second and you might even hear me.
