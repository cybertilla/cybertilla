So quiet.
I've become
so quiet

These headphones shield me
and shield the world from me

No need to hear the loud
violence around us
fades out the will to counter the voices

Words of Hope tremble,
hide back in my mind

Branches remind me
it's ok to be shy
only so long your silence does not add
to woeful illusions
Refuse seclusion
if you notice your noise
fades away into void

Sing with me
much louder
much stronger and clearer
Speak your Truth to Us
whichever it is
Information is needed
valuable, supreme

Tell your story to those
who are ready to listen
Melody is a part of your Life
vital component
the reason for your eyes
