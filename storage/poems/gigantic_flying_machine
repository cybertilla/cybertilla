The scene renders in polygons around me,
expanding from my hands:
they are clutching hard
on the shining handle
of a gigantic
flying machine.

We are soaring through clouds
miles above the seas.
The sound of propellers, a buzz of solar panels begins.
My haptic system informs me:
if I move my feet, I am dead.
They are balancing softly
on a shining rod
under the gigantic
flying machine.

Among startled-ness I feel
spikes of adrenaline, non directional, ultra rational.
That's when I see Wasabi,
grinning at my side:
they are loosing the grip
on a shining handle
of our gigantic
flying machine.

I am new here, I don't understand!
Wasabi sets their goggles,
I can still see the grin, though I hear not the giggle:
they scream a vowel
kicking the rod,
off the gigantic
flying machine.

Experience does not require my understanding,
I know how Wasabi's joy feels like. I know
its smell, its touch and its taste.
I have no explanations yet I discern.

The mechanical flying squirrel
swift as an hawk,
wise as the oak.
Wasabi spreads copper wings and glides:
holds on a new handle
up another gigantic
flying machine.

My stomach entangles, bounces and strangles.
Breathing brings order.
That's when I notice, packed on my back:
wings extra light, goggles on head.
I feel hands and feet,
burning with air.
I look at Wasabi, hundred meters away.
